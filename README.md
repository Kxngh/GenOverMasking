# Image Generation and Inpainting with Stable Diffusion

## 📚 Project Description
This project explores image generation and inpainting using Stable Diffusion models, including:
- **Image Generation:** Creating images from text prompts using Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3).
- **Object Masking:** Identifying and masking specific objects in images using CLIPSeg.
- **Inpainting:** Replacing masked areas with new content using Stable Diffusion Inpainting models.

The project leverages advanced pipelines for seamless content creation and modification.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Text-to-Image Generation:** Create realistic images from text prompts.
- **LoRA Integration:** Enhance generation using pre-trained LoRA models.
- **Object Masking:** Mask specific objects or areas in images using CLIPSeg.
- **Inpainting:** Replace masked areas with custom content.
- **CUDA Support:** Optimized for GPU acceleration with PyTorch.

## 🔧 Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install --upgrade diffusers[torch] transformers accelerate safetensors huggingface_hub
```

For CUDA support:

```bash
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

## 📈 Usage
1. **Image Generation:** Use Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) to generate images from text prompts.
2. **LoRA Models:** Experiment with LoRA-enhanced models for more detailed outputs.
3. **Object Masking:** Mask specific parts of images using CLIPSeg.
4. **Inpainting:** Replace masked areas with new content via Stable Diffusion Inpainting.

Customize prompts, adjust inference steps, and tweak guidance scales to refine your outputs.
